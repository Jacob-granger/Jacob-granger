# ðŸš€ Hello and welcome! I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer on a continuous learning journey to build on my skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Currently, I'm diving deeper into mastering technologies such as Chakra UI, Auth0, Javascript, Typescript, React, Express, SQLite and Figma. On the side I am looking to expand my skills with new technologies, such as Next.js, Angular, Bootstrap, and more!
